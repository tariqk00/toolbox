# Toolbox

This repository is for one-off scripts, experimental code, and non-automated tools used for housekeeping and management.

## Structure

- `/media`: Scripts for organizing photos, videos, etc.
- `/google-drive`: Tools for managing Drive content.
- `/experiments`: Temporary or learning-related code.

## Usage

When you have a one-off task, ask Antigravity to create a script here, run it, and commit it if it's something you might need again.
