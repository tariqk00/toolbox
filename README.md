# Organize Google Drive: Digital Life & PKM Toolbox

A comprehensive suite of tools and strategies designed to transform a fragmented digital life into a structured, GenAI-optimized Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) ecosystem.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The mission is to move beyond simple storage and create a "Machine-Readable, Human-Sortable" master environment for all personal and professional data. The effort is broken down into four distinct pillars:

### 1. QNAP Photo Archive Organization [COMPLETE]
The foundational pilot project that cleaned up years of raw photo dumps.
- **Goal**: Reorganize thousands of scattered images into a consistent `YYYY/MM - Event Name` hierarchy.
- **Impact**: 1,200+ items organized; established long-term archival patterns.

### 2. Google Drive Root Restructure & Cabinet Migration [COMPLETE]
Establishing the "Master Map" for the entire Drive.
- **Goal**: Implement a numbered 00-07 root system (Inbox, Second Brain, Finance, etc.) to optimize for GenAI discovery and human speed.
- **Impact**: Collapsed the messy "Filing Cabinet" and root folders into a unified, predictable structure.

### 3. Inbox Processing & Content Audit [COMPLETE]
Clearing the "digital debt" sitting in the Stack/Inbox folders.
- **Goal**: 100% clearance of the inbox via automated pattern matching and AI-powered visual audits (reading document text).
- **Impact**: Standardized all filenames to `YYYY-MM-DD - [Category] - [Description]` and cleared the backlog.

### 4. Deep Folder Processing & PKM Integration [IN PROGRESS]
Moving from macro-organization to micro-organization.
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **Sub-Organization**: Auditing and deep-cleaning individual buckets (e.g., Finance, Health).
    - **Second Brain Flow**: Integrating Plaud transcripts and Gemini chats into a synthesized "Logseq-ready" format.
    - **Automation**: Implementing a permanent "Auto-Sorter" daemon to keep the library clean.

## 📁 Repository Structure
