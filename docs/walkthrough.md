# Walkthrough: Organize Google Drive

This document chronicles the transition of a scattered Google Drive environment into a high-performance, GenAI-optimized digital life foundation.

## 🏛️ Pillar 1: Photo Archive Stabilization
**Phase Completed: Dec 2025**
The first major effort was bringing order to a massive, unorganized photo dump from QNAP.
- **Process**: Developed custom Python utilities to parse dates and events from filenames and metadata.
- **Output**: 1,219 items moved into a clean `YYYY/MM - Event` hierarchy, drastically reducing search time for family memories.

## 🌉 Pillar 2: The Master 00-07 Architecture
**Phase Completed: Jan 2025**
Refactored the root of Google Drive to create a machine-readable "Second Brain" foundation.
- **Goal**: Human-navigable speed + AI-ingestible structure.
- **Implementation**: Created the 00-07 numbering system. Crucially, we dissolved the old "Filing Cabinet" and merged its scattered subfolders (Finance, Health, Taxes) into these unified, high-level buckets.
- **Result**: A clean root with 100% compliance to the new architecture.

## 🧹 Pillar 3: Reaching "Inbox Zero" via AI Audit
**Phase Completed: Jan 2025**
With the buckets in place, we tackled the backlog of hundreds of files in `00 - Inbox / Stack`.
- **Level 1 (Direct)**: Automated movement of 250 files using regex pattern matching for bills, receipts, and IDs.
- **Level 2 (AI Vision)**: We encountered 37 "mystery files" (e.g., cryptic names like "Area code 631"). I used AI to visually "read" the documents, identifying them as important tax receipts, scholarship checks, and school schedules.
- **Standardization**: All moved items were renamed to the user-approved gold standard: `YYYY-MM-DD - [Category] - [Description]`.
- **Final Result**: The `Stack` folder is completely empty.

## 🚀 The Road Ahead: Deep Lifecycle Management
As we move into Pillar 4, we shift from "Moving Files" to "Managing Knowledge."
- **Focus**: Deep-cleaning the interior of the Finance/Health buckets.
- **Goal**: Full automation of the Second Brain pipeline (Notes + AI Transcripts).
